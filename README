= Queen
A simple CRUD, scaffolding extension used as a basic example in "How to Create An Extension" (http://wiki.github.com/radiant/radiant/how-to-create-an-extension)

Create a queen, view queens, delete a queen, etc. 

Simple routing from the main Radiant application.

Requires "share_layouts" extension (git://github.com/radiant/radiant-share-layouts-extension.git)

The master branch is in HAML, which I did as an exercise. If you want to see the HTML/ERB version, just clone the branch caled "erb".
